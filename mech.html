            <dd>B. Tech. in Mechanical Engineering is the flagship programme of the Department. The graduate mechanical engineers apply scientific principles to the analysis, design and synthesis of various products and processes. The range of products include: automobiles, airplanes, electronics, surgical instruments, toys, building products, sports and recreational equipment etc. In all the cases, mechanical engineers design the products with the required functionality to high quality standards at the best possible price and in ways that are environmentally-friendly.

B. Tech. in Mechanical Engineering is existing from the inception of the Institute in the year 1959. This programme is of 4 years duration (8 semesters). The course work in the first two semesters is common to all branches of engineering. The core Mechanical Engineering courses are introduced from the 3rd semester onwards. Besides, elective courses are offered from 5thsemester onwards. The electives permit one to choose his/her area of interest within the broad areas. The laboratories are equipped with state of the art equipment to impart necessary hands-on practice. The students also carry out project work during the last two semesters based on the knowledge acquired.</dd><br>
